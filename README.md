# ðŸ¦• essential-eth-deno

[Deno](https://deno.land) version of Essential Eth (https://eeth.dev/). 
Barely working, not exporting functions from mod.ts for now. In mod.ts I show how to call a smart contract, there is still a lot of issues in code though.

## Usage

Install deno and

```
deno run --allow-net mod.ts
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
deno ./test.ts
```

## Format code

```bash
deno fmt **/*.ts
```
